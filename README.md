# Sentiment Analysis in Russian News Feeds
ITMO University R&D Project

This repository contains source code used for the validation of the hybrid model in the russian news sentiment analysis.
The model was trained on the news data.

The validation results as csv files can be found in the [metrics](./metrics) directory.

The hybrid model is automatically downloaded when the corresponding image is built (the corresponding commands can be 
found in the [Dockerfile](./spark_notebook/Dockerfile))
